                    The game is very good, way better than the first one. I
                    thought the story and characters were great , i really
                    like the chemestry between Miles and Peter , the
                    narrative is great and straight to the point if you
                    want, it kept me hooked until the end. The graphics are
                    absolutely beautiful and the map is big and thats a lot
                    of things to do. If you have the PS5 it is a must-play
                    game.

                    Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a thrilling sequel that blends
                    light humor and heavier themes, while Insomniac refines
                    the formula of combat and web-swinging. While the open
                    world of New York City needs a radical rethinking, it
                    delivers Insomniac's best tale yet and remains a fun
                    superhero power trip, making fans feel like Spider-Man.
